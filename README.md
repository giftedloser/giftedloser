## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Network Engineer & Self-Taught Developer** specializing in security and networking infrastructure. I love creating programs and tools that make my job (and everyone else's) easier. My passion lies in building automation solutions that bridge the gap between enterprise networking and modern development practices.

```typescript
const developer = {
  role: "Network Engineer & Self-Taught Developer",
  specialization: ["Security", "Networking", "Switch Configs", "Automation"],
  passion: "Building tools that make work easier",
  industries: "Regulated environments & enterprise IT",
  currentlyLearning: ["React", "UI/UX Design", "Visio", "Cursor/Loveable"],
  funFact: "Also a skateboarding historian 🛹",
  nextGoal: "CCNA exam in  2025"
};
```

## 💼 What I Do

**🎯 Current Focus:** Network Engineer expanding into full-stack development
**📍 Location:** Denver, CO
**🔥 Mission:** Creating beautiful, functional tools that solve real IT problems

### My Unique Approach
- **Security-First Development:** Every tool I build considers compliance and regulatory requirements
- **Automation Obsessed:** If I'm doing it twice, I'm writing a script for it
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Deep understanding of multi-site operations and scalable infrastructure
- **Problem-Solver:** I see inefficiencies everywhere and can't help but fix them with code

## 🎯 What I'm Building  
### 🧰 TechOps Toolkit (Enterprise-Ready)  

#### 🔍 ADFuzzyFind - Inline AD Search & Management  
> Profile-integrated PowerShell tool for rapid Active Directory lookups and user/computer actions  
- Tech: PowerShell, ActiveDirectory module  
- Why: ADUC is slow and rigid; service desk staff need fast fuzzy search with inline actions  
- Features: Fuzzy/phonetic matching, relevance-ranked results, account status icons, unlock/reset/enable/disable, group removal, computer description updates, domain removal  

#### 📊 ADFuzzyReporting - AD Reporting Suite (Inline + GUI)  
> Hybrid reporting system with both inline PowerShell dashboard and full standalone GUI  
- Tech: PowerShell, WPF, ActiveDirectory module  
- Why: AD reporting is fragmented; admins need a single-pane reporting interface for compliance and operations  
- Features: Console dashboard with menu-driven reports, QuickMode summaries, custom query builder, standalone GUI for non-PowerShell users, CSV export with timestamped filenames, activity/security/OU/device lifecycle analysis  

#### 🖨️ PrinterOps - Enterprise Print Management  
> Inline PowerShell tool for managing printers in domain environments with centralized print servers  
- Tech: PowerShell, Windows Print Management, Group Policy fallback  
- Why: Printer deployments are often unreliable without robust GPOs; admins need granular device-level control  
- Features: Inline printer add/remove, connection repair, cglobal mapping support, print server integration, user/device scoped operations  

#### 📚 DocuBrowse - IT Documentation Manager  
> Unified front end for browsing, indexing, and managing IT documentation libraries  
- Tech: PowerShell, OCR, full-text indexing, 365 API integration  
- Why: IT teams lose time digging through scattered PDFs, txt files, and 365 docs; a searchable organizer is essential  
- Features: Document categorization, OCR-based text extraction, metadata tagging, search/indexing engine, inline preview, external file system + cloud integration

## 🌟 My Development Philosophy

```javascript
const myApproach = {
  principle: "If it saves me 5 minutes, it's worth 5 hours to automate",
  design: "Beautiful interfaces for ugly backend systems",
  security: "Compliant by design, not by accident",
  reliability: "It has to work at 3 AM when everything is broken",
  documentation: "Future me will thank present me"
};
```

## 🎨 Currently Exploring

- 🎨 **UI/UX Design** - Making enterprise tools actually enjoyable to use
- ⚛️ **React Ecosystem** - Building responsive, interactive dashboards
- 🤖 **Cursor/Kiro** - AI-powered development tools
- 📋 **Visio** - Infrastructure diagramming tool for documenting and automating network designs
- 🛹 **Skateboarding History** - Because everyone needs a hobby that doesn't involve keyboards

## 💡 What Drives Me

I believe the best tools are the ones that **disappear into the workflow**. Coming from hands-on network engineering, I understand the pain points that generic software can't address. My goal is to build solutions that are:

- **Intuitive enough** for the new hire to use
- **Powerful enough** for the expert to rely on
- **Beautiful enough** to make mundane tasks enjoyable
- **Secure enough** to pass any compliance audit

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

I'm passionate about building tools that solve real problems. Whether you're dealing with network automation challenges, need custom IT solutions, or want to discuss the finer points of skateboarding history - let's chat!

**Open to opportunities in:**
- 🔧 **DevOps & Infrastructure Automation**
- 🎨 **Full-Stack Development (especially B2B tools)**
- 🔐 **Security-focused applications**
- 🌐 **Network management platforms**
