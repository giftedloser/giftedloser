# Hey, I'm Marshall

Network engineer by trade. Developer by necessity — and now by choice.

I've spent years keeping enterprise infrastructure running: Cisco, Palo Alto, Azure, Active Directory, the whole stack. Somewhere along the way I started writing tools to make the job less painful, and I got hooked.

Now I build desktop apps and automation tools for the people who keep IT running. Real problems, real environments, no fluff.

Folio *(in progress)* — an infinite canvas workspace for people juggling too many projects. One canvas per project, everything local, nothing in the cloud until you want it.
