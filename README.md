## üöÄ About Me

I'm a **Network Engineer & Self-Taught Developer** specializing in security and networking infrastructure. I love creating programs and tools that make my job (and everyone else's) easier. My passion lies in building automation solutions that bridge the gap between enterprise networking and modern development practices.

```typescript
const developer = {
  role: "Network Engineer & Self-Taught Developer",
  specialization: ["Security", "Networking", "Switch Configs", "Automation"],
  passion: "Building tools that make work easier",
  industries: "Regulated environments & enterprise IT",
  currentlyLearning: ["React", "UI/UX Design", "Ansible", "Cursor/Loveable"],
  funFact: "Also a skateboarding historian üõπ",
  nextGoal: "CCNA exam in Summer 2025"
};
```

## üíº What I Do

**üéØ Current Focus:** Network Engineer transitioning to full-stack development  
**üìç Location:** Denver, CO  
**üî• Mission:** Creating beautiful, functional tools that solve real IT problems

### My Unique Approach
- **Security-First Development:** Every tool I build considers compliance and regulatory requirements
- **Automation Obsessed:** If I'm doing it twice, I'm writing a script for it
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Deep understanding of multi-site operations and scalable infrastructure
- **Problem-Solver:** I see inefficiencies everywhere and can't help but fix them with code

## üåü My Development Philosophy

```javascript
const myApproach = {
  principle: "If it saves me 5 minutes, it's worth 5 hours to automate",
  design: "Beautiful interfaces for ugly backend systems",
  security: "Compliant by design, not by accident",
  reliability: "It has to work at 3 AM when everything is broken",
  documentation: "Future me will thank present me"
};
```

## üé® Currently Exploring

- üé® **UI/UX Design** - Making enterprise tools actually enjoyable to use
- ‚öõÔ∏è **React Ecosystem** - Building responsive, interactive dashboards
- ü§ñ **Cursor/Loveable** - AI-powered development tools
- üìã **Ansible** - Infrastructure as code for network automation
- üõπ **Skateboarding History** - Because everyone needs a hobby that doesn't involve keyboards

## üí° What Drives Me

I believe the best tools are the ones that **disappear into the workflow**. Coming from hands-on network engineering, I understand the pain points that generic software can't address. My goal is to build solutions that are:

- **Intuitive enough** for the new hire to use
- **Powerful enough** for the expert to rely on
- **Beautiful enough** to make mundane tasks enjoyable
- **Secure enough** to pass any compliance audit

## ü§ù Let's Connect!

I'm passionate about building tools that solve real problems. Whether you're dealing with network automation challenges, need custom IT solutions, or want to discuss the finer points of skateboarding history - let's chat!

**Open to opportunities in:**
- üîß **DevOps & Infrastructure Automation**
- üé® **Full-Stack Development (especially B2B tools)**
- üîê **Security-focused applications**
- üåê **Network management platforms**
