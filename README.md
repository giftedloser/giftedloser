Network engineer by trade, developer by obsession. I build tools that solve real IT problems, and I'm expanding into apps and games on the side. Based in Denver, CO.

I know what it's like to be on-call at 3am when things break — so everything I build has to actually work.

```typescript
const marshall = {
  day_job: "Network Engineer & IT Analyst",
  building:  ["IT automation tools", "desktop apps", "games (eventually)"],
  stack:     ["TypeScript", "React", "Tauri", "Python", "PowerShell"],
  strengths: ["security-first thinking", "enterprise environments", "shipping things"],
  goal:      "sell apps and tools that make IT less miserable",
  also:      "skateboarding historian 🛹"
};
```

## What I'm Building

### [Scriptographer](https://github.com/giftedloser/scriptographer)
A professional script deployment tool for Windows domain admins. Multi-target execution, three deployment methods, real-time logging, Monaco editor, four themes. Built with Electron + React + TypeScript.

### Folio *(in progress)*
An infinite canvas workspace for people juggling too many projects. Freeform cards, todos, images, files, connectors — one canvas per project, all local. Built with Tauri + React.
